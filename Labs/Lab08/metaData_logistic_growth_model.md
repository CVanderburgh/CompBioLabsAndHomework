# Script for Logistic Growth Model
This script provide the following codes that could implement the **discrete-time logistic growth model**
* From code line 4-18: logtisticGrowthFun() is a function that takes r (the intrisic growth rate), K (the carrying capacity), the total number of generations, and the initial poppalation size as it argument, return with abundance of the population at n time step. 
* From code line 26-37, add code to the logtisticGrowthFun() so that it produces ![a plot of data](/Users/caihong/Desktop/EBIO4420/CompBioLabsAndHomework/Labs/Lab08/examplePlot.pdf) it generates
* From code line 59-71, used the information from [Lab04, problem# 7] (https://github.com/flaxmans/CompBio_on_git/blob/master/Labs/Lab04/Lab04_ForLoops.md) generate a dateframe and saved it as a csv file into lab08 directory.
